POS Tagging in simple terms means allocating every word in a sentence to a part of speech. NLTK has a method called pos_tag that performs POS tagging on a sentence. The methods apply supervised learning approaches that utilize features such as context, the capitulation of words,punctuations, and so on to determine the part of speech."
