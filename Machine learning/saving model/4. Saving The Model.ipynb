    "In machine learning, while working with scikit learn library, we need to save the trained models in a file and restore them in order to reuse it to compare the model with other models, to test the model on a new data. The saving of data is called Serialization, while restoring the data is called Deserialization.\n",
    "Also, we deal with different types and sizes of data. Some datasets are easily trained i.e- they take less time to train but the datasets whose size is large (more than 1GB) can take very large time to train on a local machine even with GPU. When we need the same trained data in some different project or later sometime, to avoid the wastage of the training time, store trained model so that it can be used anytime in the future. "
